# Example Usage:
loan_system = LoanEligibilitySystem()

# Add facts for individual's income and credit score
loan_system.add_fact("income", 60000)
loan_system.add_fact("credit_score", 700)

# Define rules for loan eligibility
loan_system.add_rule("Mortgage", {"income": 50000, "credit_score": 650})
loan_system.add_rule("Personal", {"income": 30000, "credit_score": 600})

# Check mortgage loan eligibility
print(loan_system.check_loan_eligibility("Mortgage"))
